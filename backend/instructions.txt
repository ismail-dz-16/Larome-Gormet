Follow these steps exactly to restore the backend environment:

STEP 1: DATABASE RESTORATION
1. Create a new local WordPress site (using LocalWP or XAMPP).

2. Install and Activate all of them.
3. CRITICAL: Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > Legacy API 
   and enable the checkbox.

STEP 3: URL SYNCHRONIZATION
Since the database was exported from a different local URL, 
you must update the links:
1. Open the "Better Search Replace" plugin.
2. Search for: http://old-url.local (The URL used by Ismail)
3. Replace with: http://your-new-local-url.local
4. Select all tables and run the process.

STEP 4: PERMALINKS

2. Ensure "Post name" is selected.
3. Click "Save Changes" (even if it's already selected) to 
   flush the API routes.
